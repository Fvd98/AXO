# AXO

Game designed through the course of 3 semesters with a wonderful team of 10 artists, 3 programmers (myself included) and 4 sound designers.

This was my first experience in actual game developpement as a whole, I learned from nothing how to use Unreal engine 4 (C++) and definitely had to go through the learning curve.

I'm very pleased of the result of our efforts!

The trailer of the game can be seen here:

I'll upload only the files that I either had major impact on or designed entirely for portfolio purposes.
